# 4G-LTE-Downlink-Simulation-Matlab
An archival upload of a project I did for the course Wireless Communications (ECE408) at [The Coopt Union](https://cooper.edu/) engineering college in 2018.

-For course: Wireless Communications (ECE408) - Junior Spring Semester
-Simulated a SISO 4G-LTE Downlink (PDSCH w/ Turbo) in MATLAB from the 3GPP Release 8 standard
-Analyzed different BER plots, fading channels, modulation schemes, equalization schemes, bandwidths, and their effects on simulation run-time
